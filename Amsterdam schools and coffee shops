# Introduction
** Given the laws regarding the distance between schools and coffee shops in Amsterdam, 
the new investors don't know which is the best distance in order not to be to close to a school, 
but neither too far from the Amsterdam interest points. It is difficult since, the interest points of the city are already 
full of coffee shops, so for the new investors, not so central places would be good to populate. This project will analyse 
some areas populated with schools and different areas of the city where are not so many coffee shops (ideally none) and where
there are not schools. 
This will be helpful for the new investors to set up an idea regarding the place where to invest in a coffee shop. **
